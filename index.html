     <p>This website provides a structured archive of the boys from the FYIMP Computational Science Batch of 2025 at Kannur University,Mangattparamba Campus. It exists to document those who made this chapter distinct—not through noise or attention, but through presence, consistency, and character. Each entry holds space for a name, a path, a mindset.<br><br>

Designed with clarity and intent, this platform doesn’t just showcase who we are—it quietly demonstrates what we’re capable of. Built using pure HTML and CSS, it stands as proof that simplicity, when done right, speaks louder than complexity. Clean code. Clean structure. Unshakable foundation.<br>
<br>
Whether you're here to revisit, recognize, or remember—this was ground zero for us. Scroll with purpose. Every profile leads to someone who stood tall, stayed sharp, and defined what it means to belong without needing to blend.<br><br>

This isn’t just a site. It’s our first mark—the beginning of a digital identity built to last.<br></p>
