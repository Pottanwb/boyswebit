     <p>My name is Nandakishor. I’ve always been drawn to understanding how things work not just in terms of technology, but also the ideas and systems that shape them. Coding, for me, is more than just a skill; it’s a way to explore structure, logic, and creativity all at once.

    <p>
      I tend to approach learning by doing. I like working things out through experience testing, adjusting, and seeing where it leads. I’m naturally curious, and I try to stay open to new ideas and challenges, even when they push me past what I already know. Growth, in my view, doesn’t come from rushing or competing it comes from consistency, reflection, and being willing to keep going.
